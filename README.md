# Finetuned_CSM_TTS
This project implements a fine-tuned version of CSM-1B, a semantic, emotion-aware TTS model that generates natural speech directly from text without explicit emotion tags. The included Colab notebook demonstrates text-to-audio generation, contextual prosody, and conversational tone control using CSM’s built-in semantic understanding.
